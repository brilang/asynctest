# Async Testing

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). At work I participated in a Dev Challenge to create an Asynchronous API workflow. Once I got that working, I used my code to duplicate the project but using the Game of Thrones API.

## Dependencies

This project uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as the library for making API calls and [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) for the concurrency option on Promise.map(). I also used [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for the UI.
